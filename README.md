## Game Suggestion Lookup

---

Game Suggestion Lookup is a project that gives you suggestions about what games to play based on a game you like. It uses [IGDB's](https://api.igdb.com) API to return a list of ten games that are similar to the searched game. Each game has a title and a quick summary.

## Motivation

---

I created this project so I could practice integrating Redux into React.

## Code Style

---

This project uses ESLINT and Prettier, to lint and style code.
